## Cryptic sexual size dimorphism

Cryptic sexual size dimorphism (CSSDI) is a bit of a strange term. How can size dimorphism be cryptic. If we can say sizes are different doesn't that imply we (humans) can detect the difference. After all cryptic as a concept in biology largely relies on the human frame of reference. We cannot tell what differences other animals can detect. No they do not all look/smell/sound/chemically signal the same. 

From a human standpoint, as if I could speak to any other, CSSDI often refers to allometric scaling differences between the sexes, where one sexes body part is larger than expected given body size.

Here we extend a line of inquiry originating with @fitch1999acoustic, and extended to examine evolutionary tradeoffs in @jones2014migrate.
