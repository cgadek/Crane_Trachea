## Cryptic sexual size dimorphism

Cryptic sexual size dimorphism (CSSDI) is a bit of a strange term. How
can size dimorphism be cryptic. If we can say sizes are different
doesn’t that imply we (humans) can detect the difference. After all
cryptic as a concept in biology largely relies on the human frame of
reference. We cannot tell what differences other animals can detect. No
they do not all look/smell/sound/chemically signal the same.

From a human standpoint, as if I could speak to any other, CSSDI often
refers to allometric scaling differences between the sexes, where one
sexes body part is larger than expected given body size.

Here we extend a line of inquiry originating with Fitch (1999), and
extended to examine evolutionary tradeoffs in Jones and Witt (2014).
